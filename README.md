# Computational Physics Models in Python

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on modeling and simulating physical systems using Python. Each project is self-contained in its own directory and demonstrates various numerical methods and data analysis techniques.

## Projects

1.  **[Computational Modeling of Sequential Radioactive Decay Kinetics](./radioactive-decay-model/)**
    * A Python model that implements and compares analytical and numerical (Explicit Euler) solutions for a three-component nuclear decay chain. It validates the numerical model's accuracy by analyzing convergence across varying time steps.
    * **Tech Stack:** Python, Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas.

2.  **Project 2 (Coming Soon)**
