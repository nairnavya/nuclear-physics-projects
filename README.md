# Computational Nuclear Physics Models in Python

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on modeling and simulating physical systems using Python. Each project is self-contained in its own directory and demonstrates various numerical methods and data analysis techniques.

## Projects

1.  **[Radioactive Decay Chain](./radioactive-decay-model/)**
    * A Python model that implements and compares analytical and numerical solutions for a three-component radioactive decay chain.
    * **Tech:** Python, Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib.

2.  **[Nuclear Reactor Criticality Analysis](./nuclear-reactor-criticality-analysis/)**
    * A multi-group diffusion model that solves the neutron balance eigenvalue problem to determine a reactor's criticality (k-eff). The analysis is performed for both a simple 2-group system and a more complex 8-group system.
    * **Tech:** Python, Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy.
